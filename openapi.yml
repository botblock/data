        The `POST /api/count` endpoint of the BotBlock API is the core endpoint that bots and libraries integrate with, allowing a bot to make a single POST call to send their guild count to all supported lists, based on the API keys passed for lists.

        _Note: This ratelimit has a 1 / 120s ratelimit for successful requests. Requests that return a 400 or 429 status code are not ratelimited._
